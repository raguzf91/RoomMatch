# Roommatch
A small personal backend project designed to demonstrate my skills. Built with Spring Boot, it uses a MySQL database, is containerized using Docker, and exposes a REST API documented with OpenAPI. Security is handled using Spring Security, and data persistence is managed through Spring Data JPA.

Roommatch is an app in which users can register for an account after which they are authenticated. They can add their apartments for renting and other users can see the current listings
